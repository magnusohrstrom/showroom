          <h2>Mastering darkness</h2>
          <p>Rembrandts numerous paintings and drawings emphesise on the contrast between light and darkness and really defines his artistic style.
            Born in July 1606 he grew upp in the city of Leiden, Holland. As a boy he attended Latin school and was enrolled at the University of Leiden, although according to a contemporary he had a greater inclination towards painting; he was soon apprenticed to a Leiden history painter, Jacob van Swanenburgh, with whom he spent three years.[11] After a brief but important apprenticeship of six months with the painter Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam, Rembrandt stayed a few months with Jacob Pynas and then started his own workshop, though Simon van Leeuwen claimed that Joris van Schooten taught Rembrandt in Leiden.[11][12] Unlike many of his contemporaries who traveled to Italy as part of their artistic training, Rembrandt never left the Dutch Republic during his lifetime.  â€“ 4 October 1669 </p>
